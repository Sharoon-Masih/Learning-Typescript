# Data types

### There are three main primitives in JavaScript and TypeScript:

#### boolean - true or false values

#### number - whole numbers and floating point values

#### string - text values like "TypeScript Rocks"

### There are also 2 less common primitives used in later versions of Javascript and TypeScript:

#### bigint(bigInteger) - whole numbers and floating point values, but allows larger negative and positive numbers than the number type.

#### symbol - are used to create a globally unique identifier.

### There are some special types as well:
#### any - any is a type that disables type checking and effectively allows all types to be used.
#### unknown - unknown is similar to any, but it does not disables typechecking and simply it accepts all type but do not assign itself to other types.
#### undefined - undefined as a special type in TypeScript that means "no value assigned yet." It's like an empty box waiting to be filled with something meaningful. When you see undefined, it means there's nothing there yet.
#### null and undefined types - JavaScript and TypeScript have two primitive values used to signal absent or uninitialized value: null and undefined.

Must review microsoft typescript learning course as well.
